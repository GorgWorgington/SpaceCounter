# SpaceCounter
This program uses the QT framework to create a GUI which keeps track of how rapidly you can press the spacebar.

To build on Linux (and probably OSX but I haven't tested it) run `./scons.py`

You may have to set the environment variable PKG_CONFIG_PATH by running `export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/lib/pkgconfig`
